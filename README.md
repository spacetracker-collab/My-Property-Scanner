**History**

This was a startup that existed for 2 years for an investment of 1 million rupees out of the pocket. In this README, I am releasing the Prezi presentation. Matterport cameras were acquired from abroad and hosted for this startup. The site generated a lot of European traffic, that was surprising. The business idea was to allow virtual real estate site visits. I was a Non Executive Board Member with no risk and only investment. We also ran 2 advertisement rounds on Facebook. I have informed the CEO (Neeraj) that this will be open sourced. The product further included a SMS component in which a given authority will be sent an SMS if someone likes the property. The business model was that people would pay for the virtual tour or may be the real estate companies would pay to get listed. The CEO won several awards and shared the stage with big ticket Real Estate Firms (He was even 3rd in an MTV DJ concert in Goa. Go figure). I think nowadays he is in the [DQYDJ](https://web.archive.org/web/20021209091429/http://www.dqydj.com/index.html) mode.  Today, REITS [Real Estate Investment Trusts](https://www.etmoney.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-real-estate-investment-trusts-reits/) in India. 

**Disclosure**

I own REITS
