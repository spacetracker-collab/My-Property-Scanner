**History**

This was a startup that existed for 2 years for an investment of 1 million rupees out of the pocket. In this README, I am releasing the Prezi presentation. Matterport cameras were acquired from abroad and hosted for this startup. The site generated a lot of European traffic, that was surprising. The business idea was to allow virtual real estate site visits. I was a Non Executive Board Member with no risk and only investment. We also ran 2 advertisement rounds on Facebook. I have informed the CEO (Neeraj) that this will be open sourced. The product further included a SMS component in which a given authority will be sent an SMS if someone likes the property. The business model was that people would pay for the virtual tour or may be the real estate companies would pay to get listed. The CEO won several awards and shared the stage with big ticket Real Estate Firms (He was even 3rd in an MTV DJ concert in Goa. Go figure). I think nowadays he is in the [DQYDJ](https://web.archive.org/web/20021209091429/http://www.dqydj.com/index.html) mode.  Today, REITS [Real Estate Investment Trusts](https://www.etmoney.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-real-estate-investment-trusts-reits/) in India allow you to have a peice of commercial real estate from a 1000$ onwards.

**Excerpt from CP Snows Lament**

Snow's position can be summed up by an often-repeated part of the essay:

A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standards of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is the scientific equivalent of: Have you read a work of Shakespeare's?[5] I now believe that if I had asked an even simpler question – such as, What do you mean by mass, or acceleration, which is the scientific equivalent of saying, Can you read? – not more than one in ten of the highly educated would have felt that I was speaking the same language. So the great edifice of modern physics goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the western world have about as much insight into it as their neolithic ancestors would have had.[5]


**INVENTION DISCLOSURE FORM**

 
**Q1. What is the problem you are trying to solve through the current invention?**
  
Typically people use techniques like Vaastu (India architectural method) or Feng Shui (Chinese architectural method) to select, prepare or modify houses to align with their needs. Such insights could be with respect to proper directional placement of house features like doors or windows, shapes and sizes of different housing elements, air flow or wind flow related modifications, water bodies and even modifications with respect to the nature of occupants.
Today it is possible to represent a house in a 3D Virtual reality based fashion using technologies like Matterport or Google Sketchup. This allows the house to be navigated and 
examined remotely. However, such models are bereft of many useful features that would aid a Vaasthu or Feng Shui consultant to suggest modifications to a customer. 
Further the customer also will not be able to understand the final house layouts after Vaasthu of Feng Shui modifications. We describe a method by which virtual reality 
models can be automatically annotated, displayed and modified with Vaasthu and Feng Shui information so as to allow quick and seamless decision making by consultants,
planners and customers.

**Q2. How was this problem dealt with before?**

There is no history of the problem being solved in virtual reality however there exists applications like Vaasthu Compass on Android that allow some form of augmented reality 
over 2D pictures. Apart from this, the only other way is for the Vaasthu or Feng Shui consultant to make an expensive trip to the housing and charge the customer.

**Q3. What are elements of the Invention? Please point out specific novel elements according to you  in the invention?**

The elements of the invention are 

a)	Creation of a Vaasthu and Feng Shui database with the required items that are needed by the consultant. This include features like directions, wind direction, sun direction, water bodies, shapes and sizes, magnetic fields and other important points.
b)	Manually annotating a Virtual Reality model (often in formats like SKP or OBJ) with relevant information as per the Vaasthu and Feng Shui Database.
c)	Allowing the   Vaasthu or Feng Shui Consultant to provide inputs on the annotated virtual reality house model as to the fitment. This will use a novel scoreboard technique.
d)	Automatically annotating and modifying the housing model based on Vaasthu and Feng Shui consultants information and presenting to the user. This is the core inventive step in the model.
e)	Provide a mechanism for the user/customer to correspond with the Vaasthu or Feng Shui consultant and refine the model in an iterative fashion


**Q4. Please illustrate inventive steps to implement the novelty? Here you may discuss over the process or algorithm and point out the novel elements specifically in the process or algorithm.**

**Q5. Is there any other way the novelty can be implemented? Here you can explain alternative process or algorithm to achieve the same result, if any?**

There are no other ways this process can be achieved. A close cousin is the use of augmented reality where the Vaasthu or Feng Shui consultant can perceive the same reality with our database in an augmented real time mode on premise and provide feedback that can be incorporated.

Similarly, it is possible that instead of annotation we could use a completely different representation of the house which is more abstract than concrete like a 2 D map to display. We focus only on 3D representations.
